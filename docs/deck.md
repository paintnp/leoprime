# LEO Prime - Pitch Deck

**5-Minute Presentation to Judges**

---

## Slide 1: Title

# LEO Prime

### The First AI Agent with Economic Agency

*An autonomous agent that acquires its own tools using real cryptocurrency*

**Labhesh Patel**
Founder & CEO, LeoDaVinci.ai

## Slide 2: The Problem

# AI Agents Hit a Wall

### Today's agents are powerful... but limited

| What They CAN Do | What They CAN'T Do |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Reason & plan | Pay for premium APIs |
| Search the web | Subscribe to services |
| Write code | Acquire new capabilities |
| Use provided tools | Act with economic agency |

### The Bottleneck:
> **Every time an agent needs a new tool or capability, it stops and asks for human permission.**

This breaks autonomy. This breaks flow. This limits what agents can achieve.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

# LEO Prime: Autonomous Tool Acquisition

### What if an agent could pay for its own tools?

**LEO Prime can:**
- Identify when it needs premium capabilities
- Evaluate costs vs. benefits autonomously
- Execute real payments on the blockchain
- Unlock and use new tools immediately

### No human approval needed. No waiting. Pure autonomy.

```
Goal → Think → Decide → PAY → Unlock → Build → Complete
                         ↑
                   Real USDC on Base
```

## Slide 4: How It Works

# The Agent State Machine

          └─────────┘                   └──────────┘
```

**Every payment is:**
- Real USDC on Base mainnet
- Verifiable on Basescan
- Logged and transparent

## Slide 5: The Tech Stack

# Built for Production

### Core Components

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Payments** | Coinbase CDP | Programmatic crypto wallets |
| **Memory** | MongoDB Atlas | Vector search & persistence |
| **Embeddings** | Voyage AI | Semantic understanding |
| **Reasoning** | OpenAI GPT | Decision making |
| **Network** | Base (L2) | Fast, cheap transactions |
| **Currency** | USDC | Stable, programmable money |

### Why This Stack?
- **Gasless-capable**: Sponsored transactions possible
- **Sub-cent fees**: Base L2 makes micropayments viable
- **Instant finality**: No waiting for confirmations
- **Stablecoin**: No volatility risk for agents

---

## Slide 6: Live Demo Recap

# What You Just Saw

### Real Autonomous Payments

1. **Agent received a goal** → "Build a TypeScript function..."

2. **Agent decided it needed tools:**
   - Voyage AI for semantic search
   - MongoDB for memory storage

3. **Agent paid $0.50 USDC per service** → Real blockchain transactions

4. **Transactions verified on Basescan** → Immutable proof

5. **Services unlocked** → Agent completed the task

## Slide 7: Why Agent Autonomy Matters

# The Future Requires Economic Agency

### Three Levels of Agent Evolution

| Level | Capability | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **L1: Tool Use** | Use provided tools | ChatGPT plugins |
| **L2: Tool Discovery** | Find new tools | Agent marketplaces |
| **L3: Tool Acquisition** | Pay for tools autonomously | **LEO Prime** |

### Why L3 is Critical:

- **Scale**: Humans can't approve every $0.50 purchase
- **Speed**: Agents need tools in milliseconds, not hours
- **Specialization**: Different tasks need different tools
- **Competition**: Agents that can self-improve will win

> "The most capable agents will be the ones that can invest in themselves."

## Slide 8: What Services Must Do

# The Other Side of the Equation

### For LEO Prime to Work, Services Need:

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Crypto payment rails** | Agents can't use credit cards |
| **Micropayment support** | $0.01 - $1.00 per use |
| **Instant provisioning** | No email verification, no waiting |
| **API-first access** | No UI required |
| **Usage-based pricing** | Pay per call, not monthly |

### The Opportunity for Service Providers:

- **New revenue stream**: Millions of agents, billions of API calls
- **No support burden**: Agents don't file tickets
- **Predictable demand**: Programmatic, not human-driven
- **Global reach**: Crypto is borderless

### We Need:
> **Agent-Native Services** - Built for machine customers, not human ones.
