# LEO Prime Demo Video Script

**Target Length**: 2-3 minutes
**Tone**: Professional, slightly futuristic, awe-inspiring

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)

**[Screen: Dark background, LEO Prime logo fades in]**

**NARRATION:**
> "What if an AI agent could do more than just think and plan? What if it could acquire its own capabilities... autonomously... with real money?"

**[Logo pulses, transforms into the app interface]**

> "Introducing LEO Prime."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:35)

**[Screen: Split view - traditional AI on left, LEO Prime on right]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Today's AI agents are powerful, but they're also limited. They can reason. They can search. But when they need a new tool or capability... they stop and ask for permission."

**[Left side shows AI hitting a wall: "ACCESS DENIED"]**

> "LEO Prime changes that."

**[Right side shows agent flowing through seamlessly]**

---

## THE SOLUTION (0:35 - 1:15)

**[Screen: App dashboard - Mission Control view]**

**NARRATION:**
> "LEO Prime is an autonomous agent that can acquire its own tools using real cryptocurrency payments."

**[Highlight the prompt input]**

> "Give it a goal..."

**[Type: "Analyze market trends and build a competitor report"]**

> "...and watch it work."

**[Screen: Timeline view showing agent states]**

**NARRATION:**
> "First, it thinks. Breaking down the task into steps."

**[THINK state card animates in]**

> "Then it searches its memory using semantic vector search."

**[RETRIEVE state - show similarity scores]**

> "But here's where it gets interesting..."

**[DECIDE state - agent realizes it needs tools]**

> "The agent realizes it needs premium capabilities - embeddings, database access, payment rails. Tools that cost money."

**[Pause for effect]**

> "So it pays for them. Autonomously."

---

## THE WOW MOMENT (1:15 - 1:45)

**[Screen: PAY state with wallet panel visible]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Using Coinbase's Developer Platform, LEO Prime sends real USDC on the Base network."

**[Show transaction happening - loading spinner, then checkmark]**

> "That's a real transaction. A real receipt. Verifiable on the blockchain."

**[Click to show receipt modal with Basescan link]**

**[Screen: UNLOCK state - entitlements appearing]**

> "Once verified, the agent unlocks its new capabilities instantly."

**[Show entitlement badges lighting up one by one]**

> "No human approval needed. No waiting. The agent made a decision and executed it."

---

## THE BUILD (1:45 - 2:05)

**[Screen: BUILD state with artifact panel]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Now fully equipped, LEO Prime completes its mission."

**[Show code or report being generated in real-time]**

> "It generates real artifacts - code, analysis, reports - whatever the task requires."

**[COMPLETE state with final output]**

> "All while streaming every thought, every decision, every action to you in real-time."

---

## THE TECH (2:05 - 2:25)

**[Screen: Tech stack visualization]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Under the hood, LEO Prime combines:"

**[Icons appear as mentioned]**

> "MongoDB Atlas for memory and vector search..."
> "Voyage AI for state-of-the-art embeddings..."
> "OpenAI for reasoning..."
> "And Coinbase CDP for secure, programmatic payments."

**[All icons connect in a flow diagram]**

> "A complete autonomous agent stack. Open source. Ready to deploy."

---

## THE VISION (2:25 - 2:45)

**[Screen: Fade to conceptual view - multiple agents working]**

**NARRATION:**
> "LEO Prime isn't just a demo. It's a glimpse into the future."

> "A future where AI agents have economic agency. Where they can discover, evaluate, and purchase the tools they need to serve you better."

**[Screen: GitHub repo]**

> "The code is open source. The possibilities are endless."

---

## CLOSING (2:45 - 3:00)

**[Screen: LEO Prime logo + GitHub URL]**

**NARRATION:**
> "LEO Prime. An autonomous agent that acquires its own tools."

**[Tagline appears]**

> "Because the best AI doesn't just think. It acts."

**[Screen: github.com/paintnp/leoprime]**

> "Try it yourself. Link in the description."

**[Fade to black]**

## B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS

1. **Agent Timeline** - Close-up of state cards animating in sequence
2. **Wallet Panel** - Balance updating, transaction appearing
3. **Memory Browser** - Similarity bars filling up
4. **Receipt Modal** - Clicking through to Basescan
5. **Code Generation** - Artifact appearing line by line
6. **Entitlements** - Badges unlocking with glow effect

---

## KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE

1. **Real Payments** - Not simulated, not testnet. Real USDC on Base mainnet.
2. **Autonomous Decision-Making** - Agent decides when and what to pay for.
3. **Transparent** - Every action is streamed and logged.
4. **Open Source** - Anyone can deploy and extend it.
5. **Future of AI** - Agents with economic agency.

---

## TALKING POINTS FOR LIVE DEMO

If doing a live walkthrough instead of scripted video:

1. "Let me show you something no other AI agent can do..."
2. "Watch the wallet balance - this is real money"
3. "See that transaction hash? You can verify it on Basescan right now"
4. "The agent just made a purchasing decision without asking me"
5. "This is what autonomous AI looks like"

## THUMBNAIL SUGGESTIONS

- Dark background with glowing wallet icon
- Text: "AI That Pays For Itself"
- LEO Prime logo with crypto symbols (USDC, Base)
